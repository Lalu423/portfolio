# Portfolio

## Description 

This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website from scratch, it needs some more work but I am happy with the results. I will continue to add upon this code as it is a work in progress to grow along with my knowledge of HTML and CSS.  

## Usage example

<img src="https://github.com/Lalu423/portfolio/blob/main/assets/images/portfolio-sample.jpg" width="500"/>
