# Portfolio

## Description 

This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website from scratch, it needs some more work but I will continue to upgrade and add new things as I gain more experience with HTML and CSS. I am excited to continue adding to this page and seeing my progress as I gain more knowledge. 

## Usage example

<img src="https://github.com/Lalu423/portfolio/blob/main/assets/images/portfolio-sample.jpg"/>
